# nhttc_ros

mushr_nhttc_ros is a multi-agent decentralized navigation system meant to take in waypoints in space _and_ time from a higher level planner and follow them while avoiding collisions with other agents. It is built on top of the [NHTTC system](https://github.com/davisbo/NHTTC). Below are install and run instructions, but the best way to get started is to checkout [this](google.com) tutorial. Detailed run instructions should be in a tutorial, this serves as a quick reference.

## Installation:
(Assuming catkin_ws exists)
cloning the repo files:
``` bash
$ cd catkin_ws/src
$ git clone --branch devel https://github.com/naughtyStark/nhttc_ros.git
$ cd nhttc_ros
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update --recursive
```

Install python requirements (assuming you are already in the nhttc_ros directory):
``` bash
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/nhttc_ros
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Compile:
Compile using catkin_make:
``` bash
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
```

## Running:
If everything compiles, you should be ready to try out the simulation example. Launch the nhttc_demo.launch:
``` bash
$ roslaunch nhttc_ros nhttc_demo.launch
```

In a new tab, open rviz (wait for 10-15 seconds if this is the first time you're launching nhttc_demo.launch):
``` bash
$ rviz -d ~/catkin_ws/src/nhttc_ros/rviz/nhttc.rviz
```

Run the route publisher node to publish some waypoints for the cars to follow.
``` bash
$ rosrun nhttc_ros route_publisher
```

## API

The nhttc_ros wrapper has the following parameters:
#### car_name (string):
The name assigned to the car (can be any string but prefer car{index number})

#### solver_time (int):
The maximum time in milliseconds for which the solver is allowed to run

#### max_ttc (float):
The maximum time-to-collision used by the solver: any agents that have a time to collision larger than this will not be considered in the cost function

#### carrot_goal_ratio (float):
The ratio of the carrot-goal/lookahead distance to the turning radius. value of 1 means that the lookahead distance is the same as the turning radius.

#### obey_time" value(boolean):
Set to true if the car is supposed to adhere to the time coordinate of the waypoints (as in, to arrive at a waypoint at a given time and not before/after).

#### allow_reverse (boolean):
Set to true if the car is allowed to go in reverse.

### Subscribers
Topic | Type | Description
------|------|------------
`/car1/car_pose` | [geometry_msgs/PoseStamp](http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/PoseStamped.html)| position of car 1
...
`/car{n}/car_pose` | [geometry_msgs/PoseStamp](http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/PoseStamped.html)| position of car {n}
`/car_name/waypoints` | [geometry_msgs/PoseArray](http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/PoseArray.htmll)| waypoint array corresponding to car_name. The z axis coordinate represents the time difference between 2 waypoints.

Note that the z axis data in `/car/waypoints` topic represents the time difference between two consecutive waypoints in a unitless fashion, and the number should be pre-multiplied by 0.001 before publishing (so that the visualization on rviz does not look elevated). 1 unit of time here is equal to (distance between two waypoints/expected speed of the agent). If the car moves at 0.5 m/s and the distance between two waypoints is 1 meter, then 1 unit of time would equal to 2 seconds.
